The code here is setup to run the R36m coastal connectivity
particle releases as defined in Dauhajre and McWilliams 2019

Not included in this directory is the ROMS output which is used
to advect Lagrangian particles via velocities.

For users wishing to create their own particle release,
add pertinent ROMS output directories and information
to ROMS_solutions_paths.py and then edit pypart_params.py
for the specific run.

Users can create their own seeding strategy by editing
pypart_init.py and pypart_funcs.py (see seeding examples defined in both)
and then editing pypart_params.py

Code can advect 3D or 2D trajectories dependeing on what is defined 
in pypart_params.py
